# Wildlife Unmasked
This is the official repository for the game Wildlife Unmasked.

It was built with Unity 2017.2.0f3, so it might require a bit of updating for newer versions.

## Adding new characters
To create new characters, you can use the Unity Editor tool, under [Jintori/Character Data]. Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/Arkaid/wildlife/tree/master/SampleCharacter) for detailed information about how to add new characters to the game
